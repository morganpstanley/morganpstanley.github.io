<h2 align="center"> Version 2.0 // <i>Polaroid</i> </h2>

### Hey, thanks for checking out my website. 👋

#### I'm Morgan Stanley. A software developer from Farmington, Utah. 

I built this website to display my portfolio projects because I enjoy designing things. Every few years or so I plan on overhauling this website and trying something new. Below I'll explain my process for both the [design](#design) and the [implementation](#implementation) for my current version, 2.0.

<h2 align="center">Design</h2>

#### *Outline*

Because I'm don't have too much info to present at this stage in my career, I had to figure out to display enough information to validate the existence of any page I created. The easiest way to do this would be to create a long-scrolling style website because each section would only need to take as much vertical space as necessary and it's a popular style in the industry, so I had lot of sites to take inspiration from. But I have several issues with long-scrolling websites; (I think) they're overused and a little more casual than the type of vibe I want to give (I'm a business casual kind of guy). So I decided to go with the more traditional look. This meant I would need the styling of the website to do the heavy lifting, otherwise most of the pages would look emtpy and unnecessary. 
<h4><i>Theme</i></h4>
I decided to let the background define the overall theme, so I built a basic outline and plugged in image after image. I narrowed it down from about a hundred to one that I really enjoyed: 

![image of sky at sunset](https://github.com/morganpstanley/morganpstanley.github.io/blob/master/src/assets/background.webp?raw=true)

I like it for serveral reasons: 
- It contributed to the overall experience but wasn't very distracting.
- It has a lot of blue, which is a mature, calming color.
- And the color saturation is consistantly low throughout the whole image, making it easier to work with. 

When I use an photograph as the focal point of anything I design, my personal preference is almost always to only use shades of black and white in the other elements for a multitude of reasons that are beyond the scope of this readme.

#### *Layout*

I decided that the nav would flow left-to-right rather than top-to-bottom to match the flow of the image. For pages with less text, like my contact and about, I choose to center the container element both vertically and horizontally to better the empty space. Scrolling on websites with a static background image is confusing and ~~always~~ often looks bad. So I decided to go with grid-based portfolio with a nav area on the left and the project description on the right. Finally, because the result was looking something like an old polaroid, I added a white border around the whole website just to seal the deal. 

#### *Typography*

I'm a huge fan of the Playfair font and try to coerce it into as many things as possible. I think it fits pretty well here with the 90s aesthetic if italicized. For the body I decided on Segoe UI, though I wanted something a little bolder for the subheading and changed that to Inter.
